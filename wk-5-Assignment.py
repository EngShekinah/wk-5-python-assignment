# This code defines a Smartphone class with methods to call and display information about the smartphone.
# It also defines a Smartwatch class that inherits from Smartphone and adds a battery life attribute.
# The code then creates instances of both classes and demonstrates their functionality.
# The Smartphone class has a method to call a number and display its information.
# The Smartwatch class inherits from Smartphone and adds a battery life attribute.
# It overrides the info method to include battery life in the output.
# The code creates instances of both classes and demonstrates their functionality.
